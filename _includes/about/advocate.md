I am a trans woman. I am queer. I am [neurodivergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity). Living at the intersection of these identities is not easy. However, I strongly believe that any trial I endure only equips me to better serve others. As long as I am living and surviving, I will use what I have been through to better understand and be empathetic towards others.


My community is my family. I am committed to support all queer, trans, and neurodivergent people. Many of my community members call me mom -- because I'm always looking out for them -- whether by cooking them food, giving advice, or just being an ear or a shoulder.


I'm always looking for more ways to support my community. Since 2016 I've been working with The Baltimore Transgender Alliance to advocate for trans folks in Baltimore. Other projects I'm working on are the Baltimore Trans Ladies' Picnic, a trans clothing closet and Bmore Trans.
